0.11
-------------

This version no longer performs binary to String conversions automatically. All bucket data is surfaced as
byte arrays. Clients will need to either perform their own string conversions or use the getBodyAsString() method
added to the com.basho.riak.client.response.HttpResponse interface.

0.10-SNAPSHOT
-------------

This version breaks compatibility with Riak releases prior to the pre-0.10 tag. Specifically, it no longer parses link walking results in prior releases.

**Changes**:

* Expect CRLF in multipart (link walking) results (http://bitbucket.org/basho/riak/changeset/df553e35cc92/)
* RiakClient.getClientId() returns the raw client ID byte[4] rather than String to avoid charset encoding issues

0.9.1
-------------

First official release of riak-client.
