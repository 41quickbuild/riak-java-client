# Javadocs #

The Javadocs contain detailed information about each class.  They can be built using:

    mvn javadoc:javadoc

Then open `target/site/apidocs/index.html`.

# Overview #

The most important classes are:

*   **ClientHelper**: executes HTTP methods

*   **RawObject** and **JiakObject**: Java representations of a Riak object capable of serializing to an HTTP request

*   **--Response** classes: parse HTTP responses from Riak

*   **RawClient** and **JiakClient**: calls ClientHelper and wraps responses in `--Response` classes

# Classes #

## Example ##

A typical fetch for an object from the Raw interface is handled as follows:

1.  User calls `RawClient.fetch(...)`
2.  Calls `ClientHelper.fetch(...)` which builds the `HttpMethod`
3.  Calls `ClientHelper.executeMethod(...)` which executes the method and fetches the response with `getResponseBodyAsString()`
4.  `RawClient.fetch(...)` constructs a `RawFetchResponse` from the response
5.  `RawFetchResponse` parses the response and constructs a `RawObject`

The other operations follow the same basic flow: Client -> ClientHelper -> Response.

## Executing HTTP Methods ##

The heart of the client is `ClientHelper`.  It builds and executes the HTTP methods corresponding to each operation.  The `executeMethod()` method performs the HTTP operation using Commons HttpClient and retrieves the response.

## Serialization/Parsing ##

While the HTTP operations are performed by ClientHelper, the majority of the work actually consists of serializing objects and parsing the HTTP responses from Riak. Serialization of objects to send to Riak is performed by the `writeToHttpMethod(...)` methods in `JiakObject` and `RawObject`. Responses are parsed by the `Jiak--Response` and `Raw--Response` classes which read the `HttpResponse` returned by `ClientHelper` and construct the appropriate domain objects.

## Client Interfaces ##

Users primarily use `RawClient`/`RawObject` or `JiakClient`/`JiakObject`.  `RawClient` and `JiakClient` are simple adapters from `ClientHelper` to the `RiakClient` interface. They use `ClientHelper` to execute the HTTP methods and wrap the resulting response with the proper `Raw--Response` or `Jiak--Response`.

# Development #

## Integration Tests ##

The integration tests perform each of the basic operations (store bucket schema, list bucket, store, fetch, modify, walk) against a running Riak instance.  They can be run using:

    mvn -Pitest clean verify

Riak must be running on `127.0.0.1:8098` with the Raw and Jiak interfaces located at `/raw` and `/jiak`. 

## Code Format ##

The files `eclipse-cleanup-profile.xml` and `eclipse-format-profile.xml` are provided to be used with Eclipse.  Import them using Preferences > Java > Code Style > Clean Up and ... > Formatter.  New code can be formatted like the current code using the Source > Clean Up... feature.
